## Purpose

The `scripts` directory contains scripts each performing an end-to-end test for the Cate CLI. 
The scripts: 

* are intended to be used as starting point for more elaborated Cate software validation tasks;
* demonstrate the intended usage of the CLI and the purpose of its various commands;
* may be used as starting point for cross-ECV analysis using ESA's CCI products.    

Note that the scripts describe a "happy path" for a given scenario and do not claim to be complete
nor scientifically meaningful.

## Usage

All scripts assume that 

* this `scripts` directory is your current directory, and 
* a valid Python environment is active. 

The latter is ensured if you use the Cate CLI from the Cate installer. If you like to run
the scripts from Python sources, you will have to create a suitable Python environment first.
The Cate development team uses Conda and a new environment is created like so
  
    conda env create --file environment.yml
       
which will create a new Conda environment named `cate-env`.

To run any script on **Linux** and **OS X**:
 
    $ source activate cate-env
    $ python setup.py develop
    $ cd scripts
    
    $ ./<script-1>.sh
    $ ./<script-2>.sh
    $ ...
      
On **Windows**:

    > activate cate-env
    > python setup.py develop
    > cd scripts
    
    > <script-1>.bat
    > <script-2>.bat
    > ...
